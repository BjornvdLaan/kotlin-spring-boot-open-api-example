# kotlin-spring-boot-open-api-example
Example of a Spring Boot-based Kotlin project that is partially generated based on an OpenAPI specification.
This code example is used in my article, found [here]().
The OpenAPI specification used in this example is borrowed from a [tutorial by Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-openapi-generator-server) and the original YAML file is found [here](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/blob/master/spring-boot-modules/spring-boot-libraries-2/src/main/resources/petstore.yml).
In that way, you can easily compare my Kotlin code with their generated Java classes.

Note: I included the `target` folder to display the full project here on GitHub. 
You should normally not add generated sources to your repository.
